The MRBS block for Moodle assumes that you will login to Moodle and then navigate to the MRBS block.
Once you are logged in to Moodle, you do not need to authenticate to MRBS.
Some functions are restricted to certain users, and other users will get the message <i>You do not have access rights to modify this item</i>.
If you are having access issues, please read the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/MRBS_block">MRBS Block Moodle Documentation</a>.
In particular, pay attention to the instructions on using Moodle capabilities under the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/MRBS_block#Installation">Installation section</a>.  
See your system administrator if continue to experience difficulties.

<a name="meeting_delete"><b>Why can't I delete/alter a meeting?</b></a>
<menu>
In order to delete or alter a meeting, you must be logged in as the
same person that made the meeting.  Contact one of the meeting room
administrators or the person who initially made the meeting to
have it deleted or changed.

<a name=repeating><b>How do I make a recurring meeting?</b></a>
<menu>
Clicking on the desired time brings you into the booking screen.
Select the appropriate <b>Repeat Type</b>. The room will be scheduled
at the same time, until the <b>Repeat End Date</b>, on the days
determined by the <b>Repeat Type</b>.
<p>
A <i>Daily</i> repeat schedules every day.
A <i>Weekly</i> repeat schedules those days of the week that you
check under <b>Repeat Day</b>. For example, use Weekly repeat
to schedule the room every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday; check
those days under Repeat Day. If you check no days under Repeat Day,
the schedule will repeat on the same day of each week as the first
scheduled day.
A <i>Monthly</i> repeat schedules the same day of each month,
for example the 15th of the month.
A <i>Yearly</i> repeat schedules the same month and day of the month,
for example every March 15th.
Finally, a <i>Monthly, corresponding day</i> repeat schedules one day
each month, the same weekday and ordinal position within the month.
Use this repeat type to schedule the first Monday, second Tuesday,
or fourth Friday of each month, for example.
Do not use this repeat type after the 28th day of the month.

By default, MRBS defines two meeting types. <b>"Class"</b> means that the meeting is being scheduled for a class of students.  
A <b>"Non-Class"</b> meeting might also be scheduled by student clubs, parent groups, etc. 
Your Moodle administrator can define up to a total of 10 meeting types, according to your needs.
Meetings are highlighted in the main calendar view with a color corresponding to their type. 
A color key of all defined types is shown at the bottom of the main calendar view.

<a name=about><b>How does the system work and who wrote it?</b></a>
<menu>
The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mrbs">Meeting Room Booking System</a>
is open source software that is distributed under the Gnu Public License(GPL).
This means that software is free to use, distribute, and modify.   
<p>
Many thanks to the original <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=5113">MRBS developers</a>.
The MRBS code was modified and adapted for use in Moodle as a custom block by <a href="http://moodle.org/message/discussion.php?id=51473">Anthony Borrow</a> and Stephen Bourget.
<p>
The system is written mostly in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>, 
which is an open source programming language that can be embedded in web 
pages similar in concept to Microsoft active server pages.  PHP is especially 
good at accessing databases.
<p>  
The database used for the system is either <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> or <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>.
MySQL is a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user and robust SQL (Structured Query Language) database server that is also GPL.
PostgreSQL is a full-featured multi-user open source Object Relational SQL database server.
Efforts are being made to extend database functionality so that the block will work with all Moodle supported databases.
<p>
The web server being used is yet another piece of free, open source
software.  The <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a> web server is
the world's most popular web server.
<p> 
The system will run on multiple platforms, including the PC architecture
using the <a href="http://www.linux.com">Linux</a> operating system.
Linux, is a free, open source, unix-like operating system.
<p>
Combining Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP is commonly referred to as a LAMP server. 
Every effort is made however to support using the MRBS block on as many different platforms as possible.
The bottom line is:<br>
<b>Every piece of this system, from the operating system to the application, is completely free - source code and all</b>.
As such it is the combined efforts of many individuals from all over the world that allow for the free use and adaptation of the MRBS software.
